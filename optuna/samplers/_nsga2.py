    """Multi-objective sampler using the NSGA-II algorithm.

    NSGA-II stands for "Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II",
    which is a well known, fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm.

    For further information about NSGA-II, please refer to the following paper:

    - `A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II
      <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017>`_

    Args:
        population_size:
            Number of individuals (trials) in a generation.

        mutation_prob:
            Probability of mutating each parameter when creating a new individual.
            If :obj:`None` is specified, the value ``1.0 / len(parent_trial.params)`` is used
            where ``parent_trial`` is the parent trial of the target individual.

        crossover_prob:
            Probability that a crossover (parameters swapping between parents) will occur
            when creating a new individual.

        swapping_prob:
            Probability of swapping each parameter of the parents during crossover.

        seed:
            Seed for random number generator.

        constraints_func:
            An optional function that computes the objective constraints. It must take a
            :class:`~optuna.trial.FrozenTrial` and return the constraints. The return value must
            be a sequence of :obj:`float` s. A value strictly larger than 0 means that a
            constraints is violated. A value equal to or smaller than 0 is considered feasible.
            If constraints_func returns more than one value for a trial, that trial is considered
            feasible if and only if all values are equal to 0 or smaller.

            The constraints are handled by the constrained domination. A trial x is said to
            constrained-dominate a trial y, if any of the following conditions is true:

            1. Trial x is feasible and trial y is not.
            2. Trial x and y are both infeasible, but trial x has a smaller overall violation.
            3. Trial x and y are feasible and trial x dominates trial y.
